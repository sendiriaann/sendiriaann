# How to Generate the GIF (yeah i copied the guide from [this wonderful dude](https://github.com/danilo-delbusso/danilo-delbusso.git))

1. 👨‍💻 Create a Web Page with the animation you want (I used [Animista](https://animista.net/)) 
2. 🎥 Record the animation using a GIF screen recorder (try [peek](https://github.com/phw/peek))
3. 😴 Make the GIF very long (30+ seconds) so that it doesn't loop too often
